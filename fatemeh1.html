            <h2>Nervous System</h2>
            <p>Your nervous system plays a role in everything you do. The three main parts of your nervous system are your brain, spinal cord and nerves. It helps you move, think and feel.</p>
            
            <p>It even regulates the things you do but don’t think about like digestion. It contains the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.</p>

            <h2>What is the nervous system?
            </h2>
            <p>Your  <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/nervous-system#1">nervous system</a> helps the different parts of your body to communicate with each other.</p>
            <p>
             Signals in your nervous system are sent along a complex network of nerve cells called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/neurons">neurons</a>.</p>
            <p>  While you only have one nervous system, it’s divided into two different parts. These are your:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Central nervous system (CNS):</li>
                <p> Your CNS is made up of your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/brain">brain</a> and spinal cord. On a basic level, it takes in, analyzes, and responds to internal and environmental information. Think of it as your body’s main communication hub.</p>
                <li>Peripheral nervous system (PNS):</li>
                <p> Your PNS includes the rest of the nerve tissue outside of your brain and spinal cord. It helps to transmit information from your CNS to the rest of your body and vice versa. It also has two parts, which include your:</p>
                <li>Somatic nervous system:</li>
                <p> Your somatic nervous system sends signals from your CNS to your skeletal muscles, which allow you to react to things in your environment.</p>
                <li>Autonomic nervous system:</li>
                <p>Your autonomic nervous system controls your involuntary body functions, such as your heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.</p>
            </ul>
