        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and other functions. The hallmark of PD is the presence of involuntary shaking (tremor), often accompanied by stiffness, slowness of movement, and loss of balance. These symptoms usually worsen over time. While PD can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages, early detection and intervention can lead to improved quality of life and increased life expectancy for affected individuals.</p>
